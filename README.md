# Pokedex

A simple web application that serves as a Pokedex for exploring the first generation of Pokemon. It allows users to view detailed information about the 151 Pokemon, including their types, abilities, and more.

### About

The Pokedex web application provides a user-friendly interface for accessing information about Pokemon from the first generation. It utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch data about each Pokemon, including their names, types, heights, weights, and images. The application also allows filtering Pokemon based on their types.

### Usage

Upon opening the Pokedex application, you will see a navigation bar at the top with various buttons representing different Pokemon types. Clicking on a type button will display Pokemon of that type. To view all Pokemon, click the "Ver todos" (See all) button.

Each Pokemon entry includes the following information:

Pokemon ID: A unique identifier for the Pokemon.
Pokemon Image: An image representing the Pokemon's appearance.
Name: The name of the Pokemon.
